# TelecomChurnPredictionandAnalysis
This portfolio project include analysis and prediction of churn of telecom customers
This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription service using supervised machine learning techniques Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription, allowing for proactive retention strategies. The insights and predictions are visualized using Power BI for better decision-making.


The dataset used in this project includes the following information: 
The columns are ['SeniorCitizen', 'tenure' 'customerID', 'gender', 'Partner', 'Dependents', 'PhoneService', 'MultipleLines', 'InternetService', 'OnlineSecurity', 'OnlineBackup', 'DeviceProtection', 'TechSupport', 'MonthlyCharges','StreamingTV', 'StreamingMovies', 'Contract', 'PaperlessBilling', 'PaymentMethod', 'TotalCharges', 'Churn']




The dataset has to be preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Classification

KNN Classification


Model Evaluation The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
Accuracy

Precision 

Recall 

F1 Score

ROC-AUC

Results-


The Gradient Boosting model provided the best performance with an accuracy of 80.65%,
